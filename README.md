# Intensity Transformation Functions

## Description
This code implements various intensity transformation functions and demonstrates their effects on chosen sample images.

## Functions Implemented
- **Image Negatives**: Inverts the intensity levels of the image.
- **Log Transformation**: Enhances the visualization of images with a wide range of pixel values.
- **Power-law Transformation**: Adjusts image contrast and brightness using a power-law function.
- **Piecewise Linear Transformation**: Allows for flexible adjustment of image intensities using a piecewise linear function.
- **Bit-Plane Slicing**: Analyzes the binary representation of image pixel values by extracting individual bit planes.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
3. Run the code, specifying the sample image filename and desired transformation function.

## Sample Images
The code uses sample images provided in the 'images' directory.

## Output
The code displays the original images and the transformed images for each implemented function.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
Install the dependencies using the following command:



*************************************2. Implement the following linear filters and show how they work using your chosen sample images. *********************

Title: Title of the project or code snippet.

Description: Briefly describe what the code does, such as applying different types of filters to an image using OpenCV in Google Colab.

Dependencies: List the required dependencies for running the code. In this case, it includes OpenCV.

Installation: Provide installation instructions for any dependencies if needed. For instance, you might include a command to install OpenCV if it's not already available in the environment.

Usage: Explain how to use the code. For example, specify how to load a sample image and adjust parameters for different filters.

Example: Provide an example of how to run the code with a sample image. You can include a code snippet similar to the one you provided, along with a brief explanation of what each part does.

Adjustments: Mention that parameters such as kernel size and sigma can be adjusted as needed for each filter.

Output: Explain the expected output of the code, which in this case includes the original image and the filtered images displayed using cv2_imshow().

Notes: Any additional notes or considerations that users should be aware of, such as limitations or potential improvements.

License: Specify the license under which the code is released, if applicable.
